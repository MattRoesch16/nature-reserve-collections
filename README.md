## Make sure node.js is installed on your computer

### node --version in your terminal

## Make sure yarn is installed on your computer (Google it)

### yarn --version in your terminal to check

## "yarn vite" starts front-end server

## "yarn start-backend" starts the back-end server

### This might not work for you..otherwise cd into 'backend' and use "flask run" in the terminal

---

## Python back-end server is not going to run after cloning it will require some setup

### Still trying to get this to work

#### This was the guide I used to get it running on my local machine

## To run back end, I used the following site to install flask locally,
## and then run 2 commands in the terminal to test the back end (on Mac)
https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/installation/#install-flask
## For MAC
## . venv/bin/activate
## flask run
## For Windows: python -m flask run
